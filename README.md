# AI Deception Dashboard

AI systems can mislead users in different ways — by fabricating information, withholding details, or refusing strategically.
This project explores how those behaviors differ internally, not just at the surface level.

The AI Deception Dashboard is a research-backed demo that surfaces deception signals using interpretability techniques, confidence scoring, and feature-level interventions.

## What this tool does

- Analyzes AI-generated responses for internal patterns associated with:
  - truthful behavior
  - deceptive fabrication
  - strategic withholding
- Estimates confidence rather than issuing binary judgments
- Visualizes which internal features contribute most to a classification
- Demonstrates causal effects via feature ablation

---

## What this tool does NOT do

- It does not claim to read intent, beliefs, or consciousness
- It does not guarantee whether an answer is true or false
- It is not a production “lie detector”

This is an exploratory transparency tool, not an authority.

## Why this matters

As AI systems become more capable, understanding how and why they mislead matters as much as detecting errors.
This project focuses on mechanistic transparency — showing that different deceptive behaviors can correspond to different internal representations.
